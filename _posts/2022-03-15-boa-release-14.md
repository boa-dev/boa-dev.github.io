title: "Boa JS engine release v0.14"
author: Boa Developers

Boa v0.14 is here! After almost 6 months of development, we are very happy to present you the newest release of the Boa JavaScript engine.
It makes it easy to embed a JS engine in your projects, and you can even use it from webassembly. See the [about](/about) page for more info.

We currently support part of the language. In this release, our conformance has grown from 41.01% to 48.42% in the official ECMAScript Test Suite (Test262).
The engine now passes 42,779 tests, coming from 33,192 in Boa 0.13 (28.9% increase), and we have closed 36 issues and merged 112 pull requests.
You can check the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/v0.14/CHANGELOG.md).

The biggest change in this release has definitely been the switch of the main implementation to a Virtual Machine. The JavaScript code first gets parsed into AST,
then compiled into op-codes, and finally executed in the VM. This adds some extra steps, which have reduced the performance of the engine, but on the other hand,
this opens the door for many great features in the future (we're looking at you, async/await), and allows some nicer optimizations in the parsing and compilation
phases in which we have already started working (such as [#1829](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1829) and [#1849](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1849)).

This move towards a VM has also brought one great new feature, generator execution ([#1790](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1790)).
