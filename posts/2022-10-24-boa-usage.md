title: "Adding a JavaScript interpreter to your Rust project"

## Introduction

When we develop tools for our users, we sometimes want to give them some form of control over how
they work. This is common in games, where we can add scripting for our users to be able to create
extensions, or even for business tools, where we allow our customer to change or extend the
behaviour of our platform. For those cases, using Rust, a compiled, type safe language can be a
challenge, since once a program has been compiled, it's tricky to change or extend it at runtime.
Furthermore, many of our users will prefer to use a more common scripting language, such as
JavaScript.

This is where Boa enters the scene. Boa is a Javascript engine fully written in Rust. Currently, it
can be used in places where you need most of the JavaScript language to work, even though, we would
advise to wait to get all our [known blocker bugs](https://github.com/orgs/boa-dev/projects/2/views/1)
solved before using this for critical workloads. You can check how conformant we are with the official
EcmaScript specification [here](https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/test262/).

And, before going further, we would like to mention that you can contribute to Boa by solving one
of the [issues][issues] where we need especial help, and we now also accept financial contributions
in [our OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/boa) page.

_Note: You can see more examples of integrating Boa in
[our repository](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/tree/main/boa_examples)._

## Starting from scratch

Let's start a new project running `cargo new my_project`, and then add `boa_engine` as one of our
dependencies by running `cargo add boa_engine --features console` in our newly created `my_project`
directory.

Let's start by adding the minimal code needed to get a JavaScript interpreter working in our
`src/main.rs` file:

```rust
use boa_engine::Context;

fn main() {
    let js_code = "console.log('Hello World from a JS code string!')";

    // Instantiate the execution context
    let mut context = Context::default();

    // Parse the source code
    match context.eval(js_code) {
        Ok(res) => {
            println!("{}", res.to_string(&mut context).unwrap());
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Pretty print the error
            eprintln!("Uncaught {}", e.display());
        }
    };
}
```

As you can see in this example, when working with Boa, you will have to use a [`Context`][context],
which will be in charge of initializing all the internals and built-in objects (such as `Date`,
`Promise` and so on). The `Context` in Boa is also your go-to place for configuring your interpreter
as you wish. You can add custom global functions, objects, and anything you might imagine. It's also
one of the arguments you will receive if you create a Rust function and expose it to JavaScript, and
with it, you will be able to throw errors, modify the global object and return values to JavaScript.

Talking about values, Boa comes with its built-in [`JsValue`][jsvalue] type. This enumeration
represents any JavaScript value that can, for example, be assigned to a variable. And, before you
ask, you can convert it to and from a [`serde_json::Value`][json-value], of course, by using the
[`JsValue::from_json()`][from-json] and [`JsValue::to_json()`][to-json] methods.

As you can see in those methods, or in the `Context::eval()` that we used earlier, you will
receive a `JsResult` as a response. This result type will contain a `JsValue` as its error variant,
which means you can return the error back to JavaScript for it to hndle it. A `JsValue`, internally,
is a garbage-collected JavaScript value. But, isn't Rust one of the few non-garbage collected
languages? Wasn't that a good thing?

The answer is _yes, of course_, but JavaScript requires a garbage collector. This Garbage collector
makes sure that all values are freed when they are no longer needed. It also makes a `JsValue`
extremely cheap to clone, independently of its contents.

## But, what can you do with Boa?

Let's start with the basics. Of course, you can execute JavaScript code. This code can be any
string or directly a byte vector (so you can load files and use them directly). You can use
[`Context::eval()`][context-eval] in both cases, as you saw before, and you can also use
[`Context::parse()`][context-parse], which will give you a [`StatementList`][statementlist] that
you can use multiple times in [`Context::compile()`][context-compile], so that you don't need to
parse the same code more than once. The compiled source code can also be executed multiple times,
since it's [`CodeBlock`][codeblock] is garbage collected, and therefore it can be cheaply cloned.
In order to execute a code block you will need to use [`Context::execute()`][context-execute].
