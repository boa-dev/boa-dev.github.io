## Summary

Boa v0.15 is now available! After around 2.5 months of development, we are very happy to present you the newest release of the
Boa JavaScript engine. Boa makes it easy to embed a JS engine in your projects, and you can even use it from webassembly. See
the [about](/about) page for more info.

Boa currently supports part of the JavaScript language. In this release, our conformance has grown from 49.74% to 60.71%
in the official ECMAScript Test Suite (Test262). The engine now passes 54,909 tests, coming from 43,986 in Boa 0.14
(24.8% increase), and we have closed 18 issues and merged 57 pull requests. You can check the full list of changes
[here](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/v0.15/CHANGELOG.md), and the full information on conformance

## How can you contribute to Boa?

Financial contributions...

If financial contribution is not your strength, you can contribute by asking to be assigned to one of our
[open issues](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee), and asking for mentoring if you
don't know your way around the engine. Our [contribution guide](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
should help you here. If you are more used to working with JavaScript or frontend web development, we also
welcome help to improve our web presence, either in [our website](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa-dev.github.io), or in
our [testing representation](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/issues/820) page or benchmarks page. You can also contribute to
our Criterion benchmark comparison GitHub [action](https://github.com/boa-dev/criterion-compare-action).

We are also looking to improve the documentation of the engine, both for developers of the engine itself and for users of the
engine. Feel free to contact us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/tUFFk9Y).
